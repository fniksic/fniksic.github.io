<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>I am a computer scientist broadly interested in programming languages,
  distributed systems, and formal verification and testing. I am currently
  employed as a software engineer at Google.</p>

<p>Before joning Google, I was a postdoctoral researcher in
  <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Rajeev Alur</a>â€™s group at the
  <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and
  a doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck
  Institute for Software Systems</a> advised by
  <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/">Rupak Majumdar</a>. Even before,
  I finished my undergraduate studies at the
  <a href="https://www.math.pmf.unizg.hr/en">Department of Mathematics</a>,
  <a href="http://www.unizg.hr/homepage/">University of Zagreb</a>.</p>
