<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Rajeev Alur</a>â€™s group at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of
programming languages, distributed systems, and formal verification and testing.
More specifically, I am currently pursuing two research directions. First,
I am interested in distributed stream processing, both from the foundational
point of view (what <em>is</em> a distributed stream processing computation?) and
the practical point of view (how to implement an efficient stream processing
system?). Second, I am interested in designing effective algorithms for finding
notoriously elusive concurrency bugs in distributed systems.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</a> advised by <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/">Rupak Majumdar</a>. Even before, I finished my undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.math.pmf.unizg.hr/en">Department of Mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.unizg.hr/homepage/">University of Zagreb</a>.</p>
